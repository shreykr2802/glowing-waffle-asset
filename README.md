# glowing-waffle-asset

Github suggested me the name **glowing-waffle**, so I just added `-asset` to it.
This repository only has some assets like useless high res images and data stores in JSON format, for my portfolio website [shreykumar.com](https://shreykumar.com/).




## Features

- Free asset hosting, thank you GitHub pages.
- Keeps the main code some what free from images and data.
